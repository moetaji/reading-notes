Git
snapshots:

Git is a distributed version to control system stores data in a file system made up of snapshots.

Local Operations:

Git mostly relies on local operations because most necessary information can be found in local resources

Tracking Changes:

Every single change applied to any file or directory is tracked by Git

Loss of Data:

Git is set up to greatly minimize the possibility of irreversible damage to files, such as accidentally lost data. 
Git makes it extremely difficult for a snapshot of your file that is committed to be lost.

States:

Files in Git can reside in three main states:(committed, modified and staged.)

Committed

Data is securely stored in a local database

Modified

File has been changed but not committed to the database
