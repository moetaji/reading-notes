<h1>The past,present,Future of local storage for web application</h1>

<p> local storage is where native client application have held and advantive over web applications </p>

**historically** web applicaions had none luxuries.cookies invinted in early web history they can be used for presistent local storage **small amount of data**but they have three dealbreaking downside.

- Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby slowing down your web application by needlessly transmitting the same data over and over
- Cookies are included with every HTTP request, thereby sending data unencrypted over the internet
- Cookies are limited to about 4 KB of data  enough to slow down your application, but not enough to be terribly useful.

 What we really want is 
 - a lot of storage space on the client that persists beyond a page refresh and isn't transmitted to the server Before HTML5, all attempts to achieve this were ultimately unsatisfactory in different ways.
