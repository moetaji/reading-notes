<h1>Table</h1>

<h2>A table represents information in a grid format<h/2>

------------------------------------
<h1>how to make a table</h1>
 we can creat a table with the tag < table>
to create  The contents of a table  written out row 
by row we follow the table tag with  < tr>
to the  start of each  row  
(The tr stands for table row.) 

It is followed by one or more 
< td> elements (one for each cell 
in that row). 
At the end of the row you use a 
closing < /tr> tag. < td>
Each cell of a table is represented using a < td>
element. (The td stands for table data.)
At the end of each cell you use a closing < /td> tag.

The < th> element is used  to represent the 
heading for either a column or 
a row. (The th stands for table 
heading.)

An object is a series of variables and functions.
Object variable is Called a property.
Object function is Called a method.
To update the value of property use dot notation; like: object.PropertyName = PropertyValue; if the object does not have that property, it will be added to the object.
also can be updated using square brackets, like: object['PropertyName'] = PropertyValue;
if you want several objects represent the similar things, use constructor.
A constructor is a function that creates an instance(Object) of a class.
constructor() method is called automatically when a class is initiated.
if you do not have a constructor method, JavaScript will add an invisible and empty constructor method.
"A class cannot have more than one constructor() method. This will throw a SyntaxError."[2]
"In a constructor function this does not have a value. It is a substitute for the new object. The value of this will become the new object when a new object is created."[3]
You can use the super() method to call the constructor of a parent class.
You can Add a Method to a Constructor.
You can use an array or object to group a set of related values.
In JavaScript, data(variables/arrays/objects/) is represented using name/value pairs.
The name in arrays and objectsis -> called key.
Each key in the object must be unique.
Array is special type of object.
Objects and Arrays ,are mutable and can be used to store a collection of data.
Objects can holds arra.
