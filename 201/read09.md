for **radio** buttons are used to prompt the user to pick only one of the options listed
**check boxes** are used when we want a user to be able to choose more than 1 value
**drop down lists** allow the user to pick 1 option of the drop down list
**select then** **attribute multiple** allows the user to pick more than 1 option from a drop down list
**input then** attribute file will allow the user to choose files
